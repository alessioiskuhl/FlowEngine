# Q & A
## What is this?
This is a Game Engine created by me (Alessio) and my Partner (Jona). I love the [Scratch Game Engine](https://www.scratch.mit.edu), but it doesn't have enough blocks, so even if it's really simple to use, the better the game you want to make is, the harder it will be to make it. 

## What features will it have?
### Community support
It will have way more community support so people can upload their own programmed blocks for other people to use. At the end you should be able to programm the blocks with a selected programming language or create blocks with already existing blocks.
### Themes
I also don't like the orange and white theme of scratch so I want to make it so you can chose from different themes or even make your own.
