# Q & A
## What is this?
This is a Game Engine created by me (Alessio) and my Partner (Jona). I love the [Scratch Game Engine](https://www.scratch.mit.edu), but it doesn't have enough blocks, so even if it's really simple to use, the better the game you want to make is, the harder it will be to make it. 

## What features will it have?
### Community support
It will have way more community support so people can upload their own programmed blocks for other people to use. At the end you should be able to programm the blocks with a selected programming language or create blocks with already existing blocks.
### Themes
I also don't like the orange and white theme of scratch so I want to make it so you can chose from different themes or even make your own.

# Installation

### The .exe file
This is definitly the easiest way to install my project on your computer. You just have to download the .exe file and run it by double clicking on it. And you're done! <ins>**But Note that this only works for Windows computers, i dont know if this works on mac computers or any other computers!**</ins>
### Raw python file
First download the python file and go to the [**<ins>official python download website</ins>**](https://www.python.org/downloads/) to download python. After installing python press windows + r and type cmd if you have a windows computer. After pressing enter or ok you will land in a window where you can type code, now you have to type cd + your download folder, it should look similar to this:

```python
cd Downloads
```
or to be safe type:

```python
cd C:/Your User/downloads
```
after doing that run this command:
```python
python Game-Engine.py
```
if that isnt working try:
```python
python3 Game-Engine.py
```
Now the file should just run, if there were any errors submit them to the [Issues tab](https://github.com/alessioiskuhl/My-own-Game-Engine/issues).
